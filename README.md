# NoHitArmorStand

Version: 1.16+

By: MRBBATES1

Description:

A person on reddit wanted a behaviour pack that made it so armor stands could not be broken by a player once placed. With this pack applied, you can place armor stands as you would normally, however; the only way to remove the armor stand is via lava (does 4 damage per tick, armor stand dies on the 3rd tick / max health is 10) or using the kill @e[type=armor_stand] command.
